# Queues - Data Structures

This a simple project on data structures using queues. A queue is a data structure wherein  
addition and removal of data units must happen from two separate directions.  
## Static Queues
Here i am implementing static queue using an array. Static because the size of the queue is predefined  
With this basic implementation you have the the possibility to:  
- Dynamically create a queue
- Print the queue
- Rermove items from the queue
- Check the first item on the queue  

## Usage:

Compile the program to have an executable  
Use the executable to explore how the program works

## DISCLAIMER:
I am open to corrections and suggestions on how to better implement this program
