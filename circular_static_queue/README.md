# Queues - Data structures

When implementing queues as a data structure, they can either be linear or circular queues  
Linear static queues have a limitation in that, they create empty spaces that cannot be used again  
This happens during dequeue operations  
## Circular Static Queues
Circular static queues are an improvement to linear static queues. They are efficient and do not create empty can't be used  
spaces in the array.  
Circular because the enqueue and dequeue operations can happen at any index in the queue  
Static because the size of the queue is pre-defined  

## Usage:
Compile the files to obtain an executable  
Use the executable to explore the program:
- Create a queue
- Add items to the queue
- Print the queue
- Remove items from the queue
- Peek the item infront of the queue
