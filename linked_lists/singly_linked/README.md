## SINGLY LINKED LISTS  
This is simple project on singly linked lists    
While learning c, i just made this program to practice on singly linked lists    
This program involves the following actions:  
  
- Dynamically create a linked list  

- Add new nodes to the list   
-> Add at the beginning  
-> Add at the end  
-> Add at any given position  
  
- Delete new nodes  
-> Delete at the beginning  
-> Delete at the end  
-> Delete at any given position  
 
- Reverse the list  

## Usage  
Compile the program, using all the files present to get your executable  
Use the executable to explore the program
